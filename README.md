# Project-Cymopolea
Natural disasters are major adverse events resulting from natural processes of the Earth and have plagued us for centuries. Fortunately, we've gotten better in mitigating and created tools that allow us to detect these events in advance which has aided us in taking proactive measures to prepare for the event.  
The project name was inspired from the greek goddess of violent storm waves, Cymopolea (kee-mo-po-laya) ([source](https://greekmythology.wikia.org/wiki/Kymopoleia)) 
In this case study, the questions we are primarily trying to answer here are, given a sea of text content from social media platforms and any images that are attached with them: 
1. How do you identify what is relevant information for emergency response personnel? 
2. What sort of implementation would be valuable? 

## Why Bother? 

- Monetary reasons: Global disasters can cause damage to building infrastructure to the note of billions of dollars every year. And its only rising. Last year, damages were up by 26% from 2019 to $166 billion with $82 billion worth of damage insured last year up by 44% from 2019. (source: [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-global-catastrophes))
- Preventable loss of human life: Last yearâ€™s natural disasters claimed approximately 8,200 lives (source: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/natural-disasters-cost-usd210-billion-worldwide-in-2020-5094629))
- Protecting against insurance fraud: A catastrophe greatly magnifies the opportunity for fraud and abuse. Providing real time feedback to insurance agencies can help prevent this. [NICB](https://www.nicb.org/disaster-tips)
