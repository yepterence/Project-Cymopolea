# Project-Cymopolea
Natural disasters are major adverse events resulting from natural processes of the Earth and have plagued us for centuries. Fortunately, we've gotten better in mitigating and created tools that allow us to detect these events in advance which has aided us in taking proactive measures to prepare for the event.  
The project name was inspired from the greek goddess of violent storm waves, Cymopolea (kee-mo-po-laya) ([source](https://greekmythology.wikia.org/wiki/Kymopoleia)) 
With twitter 
1. How do you identify what is relevant information for emergency response personnel? 
2. What sort of implementation would be valuable? 

## Why Bother? 

- Monetary reasons: Global disasters caused losses world-wide in 2020 that totaled $210 billion dollars which is up by 26% from 2019 to $166 billion with $82 billion worth of damage insured last year up by 44% from 2019. (source: [Insurance Information Institute](https://www.iii.org/fact-statistic/facts-statistics-global-catastrophes))
- Preventable loss of human life: Last yearâ€™s natural disasters claimed approximately 8,200 lives (source: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/natural-disasters-cost-usd210-billion-worldwide-in-2020-5094629))
- Protecting against insurance fraud: A catastrophe greatly magnifies the opportunity for fraud and abuse. Providing real time feedback to insurance agencies can help prevent this. [NICB](https://www.nicb.org/disaster-tips)

## Methodology 

- Use NLTK 
## Data sources
